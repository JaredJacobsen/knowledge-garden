This is my first note. I guess I'll write a page about myself: [[Jared Jacobsen]]

I use Roam to tend my private knowledge garden, but this is my first time taking public notes. A few thoughts

- It feels like I'm writing a blog post or something.
- It requires a lot of work to make my notes understandable to others, which kind of feels like a waste of time because I don't know why anyone else would read this.
- It kind of feels like oversharing.
- I will continue to use Roam because many of my notes should stay private simply because others wouldn't be care.
  - But this fragments my notes in two, which I don't like.
- [[question]] is there a useful guide out there describing the why and how of public knowledge gardening?

[[Foam]] is a cool Roam alternative. Living in vscode, the affordances are endless.
